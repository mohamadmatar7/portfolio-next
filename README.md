# Portfolio – Interactive & Full-Stack Developer

Personal portfolio website showcasing selected projects, case studies, and system architectures.  
Built with a strong focus on **clean UI systems**, **reusability**, and **real-world engineering thinking**.

---

## ✨ Overview

This portfolio is not just a visual showcase, but a **structured frontend system** designed to scale:

- Consistent layout primitives across all pages
- Reusable UI components (headers, cards, dividers)
- Clear separation between content, layout, and presentation
- Case studies with real system architecture visualizations

The goal is to reflect how I actually build production-ready applications.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Next.js (App Router)**
- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Three.js / React Three Fiber**
- **Docker**
- **Raspberry Pi / Hardware integration**

## 🧩 UI System Philosophy

This project is built around **layout primitives**, not page-specific hacks.

### Core primitives:
- **PageSection** – consistent root section
- **PageHeader** – shared header system
- **InfoCard** – flexible content card
- **Divider** – lightweight visual separator

This keeps the UI predictable, maintainable, and scalable.

## 🧠 Case Studies

Each project page includes:
- Clear project context
- Technology stack
- Personal role & responsibilities
- Key learnings
- Interactive 3D system architecture (when relevant)

---

## 🌍 Internationalization

- Custom lightweight i18n system
- No hard-coded UI strings
- Easy to extend languages

---

## 🎯 Goals of This Project

- Demonstrate real frontend architecture skills
- Show understanding of system design
- Keep UI clean, calm, and professional
- Avoid over-engineering
- Reflect real-world development practices

## 🧠 Final Note

This portfolio is intentionally minimal, structured, and honest.  
Every design and architectural decision reflects how I approach real projects.

No fluff. No templates. Just systems.
